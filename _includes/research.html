                            <strong>Abstract—</strong>Phase shifting techniques have advanced significantly in recent years, with particular emphasis on opto-electric, thermal-optic, and liquid crystal-based phase shifters. Behind the development of solid optical communication systems, controlling the phase of a signal is an essential process. Typically used with waveforms, electromagnetic waves, or light, a phase shifter is a fundamental electrical or optical device that is essential for adjusting the phase of signals. This study highlights these categories' critical functions in optical signal phase modification by providing a thorough investigation of them. Opto-electric phase shifters are essential to quantum optics and high-speed optical communication systems. Thermal-optic shifters are used in laser beam shaping and optical adaptation because of their thermally-driven fluctuations in refractive index. In order to shed light on their application in spatial light modulators and displays, the paper also explores liquid crystal phase shifters, which make use of electrically regulated birefringence. Performance assessments, constraints, and potential applications are explored throughout the study, especially in light of new developments like 5G networks and quantum telecommunications.
